# BST Visualizer

## Binary Search Tree - Traversal Visualizer 
Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder Traversal

### Description

Made with pygame, this project creates a visual representation of an Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder Traversal of a Binary Search Tree. 

When I was learning about inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals, it was difficult to find something like this. So, I wanted to make it for other people to see. I hope this visualizer helps people get a better understanding of those three traversal types.
